=== 3RD party LIBS FOLDER ============================================

here are the external libraries bundled with the project. 

CAPD library is excluded from this folder, unless bundled version
were downloaded. If capd is present, then there is a script for 
local build of this library. 

SciRSc library is a bunch of simple scripts I made during years for
helper things. Probably, it could be done better with third party
libraries (boost? etc...).
