DOCUMENTATION
=============

This folder contains auto-generated Doxygen documentation
and some other useful documents for reference.

To see Doxygen-generated documentation, open the file **html/index.html**.

TODO: The Doxygen documentation is in a very poor state now. Work on it. 

To generate .pdf of the Doxygen documentation, just
run ```make all``` inside **tex** folder, but this is probably
not useful at all...

***NOTE***: since html folder of doxygen docs are a mess,
I have made ```index.html``` in this directory. It redirects
to the ```html/index.html``` of doxygen when opened.
