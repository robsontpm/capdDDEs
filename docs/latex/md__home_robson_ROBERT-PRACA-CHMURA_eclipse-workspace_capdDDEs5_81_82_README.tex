In case of any problems, please contact me at \href{mailto:robert.szczelina@uj.edu.pl}{\texttt{ robert.\+szczelina@uj.\+edu.\+pl}} -\/ I will provide as much support as possible, especially I will contact people from C\+A\+PD project if there would be any problems with building it. Please attach as much information as possible (e.\+g. output of build.\+sh / configure / make programs),version of your OS, maybe some screenshots.

Aditional programs (proofs) are usually attached to the recent manuscripts, see the References section below.\hypertarget{md__home_robson_ROBERT-PRACA-CHMURA_eclipse-workspace_capdDDEs5_81_82_README_autotoc_md1}{}\doxysection{D\+E\+S\+C\+R\+I\+P\+T\+I\+O\+N O\+F T\+H\+I\+S P\+R\+O\+J\+E\+CT}\label{md__home_robson_ROBERT-PRACA-CHMURA_eclipse-workspace_capdDDEs5_81_82_README_autotoc_md1}
The repository contains source codes for the rigorous integration library for Delay Differential Equations (D\+D\+Es) of the form\+:


\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{x'(t) = f(x(t), x(t-\/d1), ..., x(t-\/dm))}
\end{DoxyCode}


Where d1,..., dm are m delays. It is build upon ideas from C\+A\+PD library for O\+D\+Es (capd.\+ii.\+uj.\+edu.\+pl). By rigorous methods we understand routines that compute the enclosure (interval bounds) on the {\bfseries{true}} solutions to the problems, which enable applying them in Computer Assisted Proofs. Please reffer to \href{capd.ii.uj.edu.pl}{\texttt{ C\+A\+PD}} documentation for general papers on the topic. And see References for the ones specyfic to D\+D\+Es.

This projec requires the \href{capd.ii.uj.edu.pl}{\texttt{ C\+A\+PD library}}, but the repository contains compatible C\+A\+PD version in \textquotesingle{}./external/\textquotesingle{} directory. You can use your own version of the C\+A\+PD, but in that case you need to modify {\ttfamily C\+A\+P\+D\+B\+I\+N\+D\+IR} and {\ttfamily C\+A\+P\+D\+L\+I\+B\+D\+IR} variables in the template Makefile scripts {\ttfamily build-\/conf.\+mk} and {\ttfamily build-\/conf-\/mp.\+mk}. ~\newline

The integrator is written as a template-\/based C++ library and heavily uses C\+A\+PD library routines for rigorous numerics. The main part, that is designed to be used separately, is contained in \textquotesingle{}include/capd/ddes\textquotesingle{}. As of 2020 we aim to incorporate this part of the library in the core of C\+A\+PD Dyn\+Sys project. For details about C\+A\+PD see \href{http://capd.ii.uj.edu.pl}{\texttt{ http\+://capd.\+ii.\+uj.\+edu.\+pl}} . Files in \textquotesingle{}include/capd/ddes\+Helper\textquotesingle{} are designed to be outside of the base implementation and they aim at providing simple algorithms to create, manipulate and refine initial data for the integrator.

This project also contains several programs under examples directory those programs can be build issuing the following command\+: \begin{DoxyVerb}make [program_name]
\end{DoxyVerb}


where \mbox{[}program\+\_\+name\mbox{]} is equal to the name of any directory under \textquotesingle{}examples/\textquotesingle{}. The resulting executable file will go to the bin/examples/\mbox{[}program\+\_\+name\mbox{]} directory.

The most important part is the rigorous integrator for D\+D\+Es (D\+DE library). It is contained in include/capd/ddes. As of 2022, I have decided to reorganize it again to be more complaint with the C\+A\+PD structure. I have followed example of \textquotesingle{}external/capd/capd\+Dyn\+Sys4/include/capd/pdes\textquotesingle{} in this manner.

As of 2022 the integrator uses C\+A\+PD Dyn\+Sys version 5.\+1.\+2.\hypertarget{md__home_robson_ROBERT-PRACA-CHMURA_eclipse-workspace_capdDDEs5_81_82_README_autotoc_md3}{}\doxysection{C\+O\+M\+P\+I\+L\+A\+T\+I\+O\+N O\+F T\+H\+E L\+I\+B\+R\+A\+R\+Y O\+N\+D C\+U\+S\+T\+O\+M P\+R\+O\+G\+R\+A\+MS}\label{md__home_robson_ROBERT-PRACA-CHMURA_eclipse-workspace_capdDDEs5_81_82_README_autotoc_md3}
If you have downloaded version without C\+A\+PD and want to use your own version of this library, then you need to modify file \textquotesingle{}build-\/conf.\+mk\textquotesingle{} first. Follow the instructions in that file to make the Makefile work.

If you have version with bundled C\+A\+PD library (there is \textquotesingle{}./external/capd\textquotesingle{} folder), then you need to build it first.

A script \textquotesingle{}capd-\/build.\+sh\textquotesingle{} in \textquotesingle{}./external\textquotesingle{} can do everything automatically\+: \begin{DoxyVerb}# first, build CAPD (it is a long process)
cd external
# add permission to helper scripts if neccessary
chmod a+x capd/configure
chmod a+x build.sh
./build.sh
\end{DoxyVerb}


Finally, you can check C\+A\+PD build by entering\+: \begin{DoxyVerb}cd external/capd_build
make check
\end{DoxyVerb}


In case of any errors in compiling C\+A\+PD library, please check requirements on \href{http://capd.ii.uj.edu.pl,}{\texttt{ http\+://capd.\+ii.\+uj.\+edu.\+pl,}} or contact me at \href{mailto:robert.szczelina@uj.edu.pl}{\texttt{ robert.\+szczelina@uj.\+edu.\+pl}}.\hypertarget{md__home_robson_ROBERT-PRACA-CHMURA_eclipse-workspace_capdDDEs5_81_82_README_autotoc_md4}{}\doxysubsection{C\+A\+P\+D v. 5 A\+N\+D S\+H\+A\+R\+E\+D L\+I\+B\+R\+A\+R\+I\+E\+S (\+U\+P\+D\+A\+T\+E\+D 2022)}\label{md__home_robson_ROBERT-PRACA-CHMURA_eclipse-workspace_capdDDEs5_81_82_README_autotoc_md4}
In a C\+A\+PD v5 there is a problem with compiled program, when the library was installed localy. The system does not see the dynamically linked libraries.

From \textquotesingle{}make install\textquotesingle{} of C\+A\+PD you get info\+:

Libraries have been installed in\+: /home/robson/workspace/capd\+D\+D\+Es5.1.\+2/bin/capd/lib

If you ever happen to want to link against installed libraries in a given directory, L\+I\+B\+D\+IR, you must either use libtool, and specify the full pathname of the library, or use the \textquotesingle{}-\/L\+L\+I\+B\+D\+IR\textquotesingle{} flag during linking and do at least one of the following\+:
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item add L\+I\+B\+D\+IR to the \textquotesingle{}L\+D\+\_\+\+L\+I\+B\+R\+A\+R\+Y\+\_\+\+P\+A\+TH\textquotesingle{} environment variable during execution
\item add L\+I\+B\+D\+IR to the \textquotesingle{}L\+D\+\_\+\+R\+U\+N\+\_\+\+P\+A\+TH\textquotesingle{} environment variable during linking
\item use the \textquotesingle{}-\/Wl,-\/rpath -\/Wl,L\+I\+B\+D\+IR\textquotesingle{} linker flag
\item have your system administrator add L\+I\+B\+D\+IR to \textquotesingle{}/etc/ld.so.\+conf\textquotesingle{}
\end{DoxyItemize}

See any operating system documentation about shared libraries for more information, such as the ld(1) and ld.\+so(8) manual pages.

For now, I do the following\+:
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item create file \textquotesingle{}/etc/ld.so.\+conf.\+d/\+C\+A\+P\+Dv5.conf\textquotesingle{} with the L\+I\+B\+D\+IR in it\+:

sudo cat \textquotesingle{}/home/robson/workspace/capd\+D\+D\+Es5.1.\+2/bin/capd/lib\textquotesingle{} $>$ /etc/ld.so.\+conf.\+d/\+C\+A\+P\+Dv5.conf
\item reload ldconfig\+:

sudo ldconfig
\end{DoxyItemize}

This need admin rights. I think the option


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item use the \textquotesingle{}-\/Wl,-\/rpath -\/Wl,L\+I\+B\+D\+IR\textquotesingle{} linker flag
\end{DoxyItemize}

could work better, it can be implemented with Makefile. T\+O\+DO\+: Try to implement this method instead of ldconfig.

A short description of available folders / files. A detailed R\+E\+A\+D\+M\+E.\+txt file can be found in some of them, when necessary. The project is in constant evolution, so changes can be made. When the core part of library would become part of C\+A\+PD, then the structure would be more or less constant.


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item include/
\item include/ddes the core of the rigorous integrator for D\+D\+Es The most important files\+:

\item T\+O\+DO\+:

\item T\+O\+DO\+:
\end{DoxyItemize}
\item include/ddeshelper some extra routines to help with programs. Might not be the part of the C\+A\+PD library, when ddes are included.
\item examples/ here are all the programs from computer assisted proofs. For now, only data from the latest paper is included. For data from older papers, check the links in respective manuscripts.
\item Makefile this file may be used to build programs inside the library just call\+: \begin{DoxyVerb}make [program_name]
\end{DoxyVerb}


where \mbox{[}program\+\_\+name\mbox{]} is equal to the name of any directory under examples/. The resulting executable file will go to the bin/examples/\mbox{[}program\+\_\+name\mbox{]} directory.
\item external/ You should build C\+A\+PD from this folder. The instructions are somwhere in this R\+E\+A\+D\+M\+E.\+txt file. ~\newline

\item script/ some usefull scripts in languages other than C++ (bash / Python / tex) they are used in some proofs to generate human-\/readable output (e.\+g. the formulation of existence theorems with nice estimates) This folder is there only if neccessary
\item bin/ this directory is initially empty. If you will compile any program which accompany the library in examples/ folder, then it will be placed here. Also bundled version of C\+A\+PD will be here.
\item build-\/conf.\+mk build-\/conf-\/mp.\+mk this file serve to configure compilation (make), see above for the instruction on compilation. The -\/mp version is used for multiprecision compilation (see for example converter programs)
\item R\+E\+A\+D\+M\+E.\+txt this file
