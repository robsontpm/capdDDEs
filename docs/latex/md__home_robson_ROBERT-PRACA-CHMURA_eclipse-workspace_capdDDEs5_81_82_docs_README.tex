This folder contains auto-\/generated Doxygen documentation and some other useful documents for reference.

To see Doxygen-\/generated documentation, open the file {\bfseries{html/index.\+html}}.

T\+O\+DO\+: The Doxygen documentation is in a very poor state now. Work on it.

To generate .pdf of the Doxygen documentation, just run {\ttfamily make all} inside {\bfseries{tex}} folder, but this is probably not useful at all...

{\itshape {\bfseries{N\+O\+TE}}}\+: since html folder of doxygen docs are a mess, I have made {\ttfamily index.\+html} in this directory. It redirects to the {\ttfamily html/index.\+html} of doxygen when opened.
