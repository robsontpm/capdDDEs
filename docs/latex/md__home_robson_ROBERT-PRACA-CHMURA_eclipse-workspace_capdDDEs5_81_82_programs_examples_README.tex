This folder contains exemplary programs to show how to use the library.

As an example consider {\bfseries{demo-\/elninio}} folder. You can compile it by invoking {\ttfamily make all} inside the {\bfseries{demo-\/elninio}} folder, or by invoking {\ttfamily make examples/demo-\/elninio} in the root directory of the repository.

The executables will be created in {\bfseries{demo-\/elninio/bin}} folder, and you can execute {\ttfamily bash run-\/demos.\+sh} inside the {\bfseries{demo-\/elninio}} folder to run some demonstrations. The output will go into {\bfseries{demo-\/elninio/bin}} folder.

All other examples will provide similar functionality.

You can copy any example folder into $\ast$$\ast$../devel$\ast$$\ast$ folder and experiment with it/modify it to your liking.

See documentation in $\ast$$\ast$../devel$\ast$$\ast$ folder to learn how to make your own programs.
