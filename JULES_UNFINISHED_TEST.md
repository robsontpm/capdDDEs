# Notes on Tests

## BasicDoubleton.h (DONE)
- Tests implemented in `tests/capd-ddes-storage-BasicDoubleton.cpp`. Coverage > 94%.
- **Known Bug 1:** Constructor `BasicDoubleton(size_type d, size_type N0 = -1)` fails due to unsigned underflow of `N0 = -1`.
- **Known Bug 2:** Constructor `BasicDoubleton(VectorType* x, ...)` fails to compile due to passing pointers instead of references to `setupFromData` and ambiguous `VectorType(0)`.
- These bugs are marked in the header file and corresponding tests are disabled or avoided.
