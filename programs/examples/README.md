Exemplary programs
==================

This folder contains exemplary programs to show 
how to use the library. 

As an example consider **demo-elninio** folder. 
You can compile it by invoking ```make all```
inside the **demo-elninio** folder, or by
invoking ```make examples/demo-elninio``` in the
root directory of the repository.

The executables will be created in **demo-elninio/bin**
folder, and you can execute ```bash run-demos.sh```
inside the **demo-elninio** folder to run some
demonstrations. The output will go into 
**demo-elninio/bin** folder. 

All other examples will provide similar functionality.

You can copy any example folder into **../devel**
folder and experiment with it/modify it to your liking. 

See documentation in **../devel** folder to learn
how to make your own programs.
