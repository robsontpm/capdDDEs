/*
 * Here we reproduce the results from the following source:
 *
 *     [1] http://capd.sourceforge.net/capdDynSys/docs/html/examples_RosslerChaoticDynamics.html
 *
 * See there for the definition of two-parameter R\"ossler ODE system.
 *
 * For parameters a=5.7, b=0.2, we do the computer assisted proof of two assertions:
 * (1) There exists trapping region A for the system where the attractor exists
 * (2) There exists a subset of A on which the dynamics is chaotic
 *     (a conjugacy to the shift on 2 symbols for a second iteration of a Poincare map to the section x=0)
 *
 * We also show that DDE code can be used to integrate ODEs almost in the same way as in CAPD,
 * when the number of delays is 0 (no delays).
 *
 * The program is a little bit expanded, to provide more output and to produce some pictures for gnuplot.
 * The original code for the topological conditions is in the file 'capd-original-code.cpp'
 *
 * NOTE: The code is very similar to ODE as we are dealing with ODEs and we does not need to compare
 *       Solution Segments. The code is more involved when dealing with solution segments, but this
 *       cannot be avoided (similarly in PDEs you cannot avoid treatment of the infinite dimensional
 *       Tail part, see works of D. Wilczak and P. Zgliczy≈Ñski about CAPD use in PDEs for reference).
