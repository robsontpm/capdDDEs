/* * TODO: (!!!URGENT): right docs! * * Here we reproduce the results from the following source: * *     [1] http://capd.sourceforge.net/capdDynSys/docs/html/examples_RosslerChaoticDynamics.html * * See there for the definition of two-parameter R\"ossler ODE system. * * For parameters a=5.7, b=0.2, we do the computer assisted proof of two assertions: * (1) There exists trapping region A for the system where the attractor exists * (2) There exists a subset of A on which the dynamics is chaotic *     (a conjugacy to the shift on 2 symbols for a second iteration of a Poincare map to the section x=0) * * We also show that DDE code can be used to integrate ODEs almost in the same way as in CAPD, * when the number of delays is 0 (no delays). * * The program is a little bit expanded, to provide more output and to produce some pictures for gnuplot. * The original code for the topological conditions is in the file 'capd-original-code.cpp' * * NOTE: The code is very similar to ODE as we are dealing with ODEs and we does not need to compare *       Solution Segments. The code is more involved when dealing with solution segments, but this *       cannot be avoided (similarly in PDEs you cannot avoid treatment of the infinite dimensional *       Tail part, see works of D. Wilczak and P. Zgliczy≈Ñski about CAPD use in PDEs for reference). */// comment or uncomment the following for extra options// DDES_ALLOW_SYSTEM 		when uncommented, the program can produce some pictures from the proof,//							you need gnuplot installed fpr this to work, and system() command available in C++// CHECK_TRAPPING_REGION 	checking that the trapping region exists is a long run (many subdivisions),//							if you only interested in the proof of (2) then you can uncomment it// EXTRA_OUTPUT				uncommenting this will output more information to the standard output#define DDES_ALLOW_SYSTEM#define CHECK_TRAPPING_REGION//#define EXTRA_OUTPUT// ====================== DO NOT MODIFY ANYTHING BELOW THIS LINE ===========================================#include "rig-setup.h"
